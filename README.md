In the future I would love to come back to this project and create more stages with more enemy characters with beautiful patterns to dodge through, as well as a system to keep track of the high score. It was so much fun developing this little game and dealing with so many bugs at the beginning made the result so much more satisfying. I think I definitely achieved my goal of learning something new.

*Developed over one month as a passion project. Seeing my siblings enjoy the final result was the best reward!*
